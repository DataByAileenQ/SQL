# Customer Churn Analysis

This project explores customer churn behavior within the telecommunications industry. By analyzing customer demographics, contract types, payment methods, and tenure, I developed actionable insights to improve retention strategies and reduce churn rates. The analysis demonstrates my ability to clean data, perform exploratory analysis, and create compelling visualizations.

---

## Key Insights

- **Contract Types**: Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit an 88.55% churn rate, highlighting the need for incentives to promote longer-term contracts.
- **Payment Methods**: Customers using electronic checks have the highest churn rate (15.21%), suggesting a need to encourage automated payment methods.
- **Tenure**: Churn is highest within the first 5 years, emphasizing the importance of early-stage retention efforts.
- **Demographics**: Customers without dependents or partners are more likely to churn, indicating potential for targeted offers to these groups.

## Recommendations

1. **Incentivize Long-Term Contracts**:
   - Offer discounts or exclusive benefits for 1â€“2 year contracts to reduce churn.
2. **Promote Automated Payments**:
   - Provide loyalty rewards or discounts for customers who use automatic payment methods.
3. **Targeted Offers**:
   - Develop family-oriented plans or partner discounts to retain customers without dependents or partners.

## Limitations

- **Demographics**: The dataset lacked age and income information, limiting customer segmentation capabilities.
- **Pricing Data**: More detailed service pricing data would enable better analysis of price sensitivity and service value.
